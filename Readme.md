# C# SOLID Principles Implementation

This repository contains multiple .NET 8 ( C# 12 ) console applications, each implementing one of the SOLID principles.

## SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help in writing maintainable and scalable software.

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class should have only one reason to change.
2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Project Structure

Each console application in this repository focuses on implementing one of the SOLID principles. The project structure is as follows:

- `SRP`: Single Responsibility Principle implementation.
- `OCP`: Open-Closed Principle implementation.
- `LSP`: Liskov Substitution Principle implementation.
- `ISP`: Interface Segregation Principle implementation.
- `DIP`: Dependency Inversion Principle implementation.

## Getting Started

To run each application, follow the instructions provided in the respective project's README file.

## Current Progress

At the moment, the solution contains one project for the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) implementation. This project demonstrates how to design software entities that are open for extension but closed for modification.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Note

In this solution, I have utilized GitHub Copilot solely for the purpose of generating XML comments and this readme file.
